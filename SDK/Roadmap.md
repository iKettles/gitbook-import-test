## 1. Themes

These broad themes guide our prioritization:

- **Portability**: Support more platforms and runtimes (Edge, WASM, Native).
- **Replayability**: Deterministic logs, replay files, branching timelines.
- **Customisation**: Plugin hooks, custom board assets, AI strategy control.
- **Offline-first**: Reliable persistence and P2P multiplayer without a server.
- **Security & Integrity**: Cheat detection, signed turns, secure token auth.

## 3. Planned (Q3â€“Q4 2025)

| Feature                    | Description                                                  |

| **Plugin marketplace**     | Registry of verified themes, AI opponents, UI packs          |
| **Command middleware API** | Add logging, metrics, or access control at command level     |
| **E2E encrypted tokens**   | JWT-like ephemeral access tokens with public key auth        |

## 4. Future Ideas (2026+)

These are not yet scheduled but under consideration:

- âœ… CRDT-based peer-to-peer sync (no central server)
- âœ… Alternative transports: GraphQL, MQTT
- âœ… Visual game replay viewer
- âœ… Node.js CLI to simulate headless games
- âœ… Tournament mode (up to 64 players)
- âœ… Plugin-based ruleset engine (e.g. "free parking cash")
- âœ… Portable save files for exporting game states
- âœ… Full rewrite of core engine in Rust (targeting WASI and native)

## 5. Out of Scope

Some frequently requested ideas that weâ€™ve chosen not to pursue:

| Idea                                              | Reason                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Realtime voice chat**                           | Better handled by third-party tools (e.g. Discord SDK) |
| **Support for house rules in SaaS tier**          | Reserved for enterprise licenses due to complexity     |
| **Embedding Monopoly inside iframe game portals** | Violates Hasbro licensing guidelines                   |
