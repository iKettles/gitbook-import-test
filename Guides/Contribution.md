## 4. Running Tests

Unit and integration tests live in the SDK package.

```bash
yarn workspace @monopoly/sdk test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
yarn test --watch
```

Generate coverage:

```bash
yarn test --coverage
```

---

## 5. Linting & Formatting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier.

```bash
yarn lint
```

Auto-fix issues:

```bash
yarn lint --fix
```

Check formatting:

```bash
yarn prettier --check .
```

Fix formatting:

```bash
yarn prettier --write .
```

---

## 6. Committing Changes

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat(session): add support for custom dice values
fix(api): handle 401 errors from token endpoint
```

Use the `yarn commit` helper (powered by `commitizen`) to follow the format:

```bash
yarn commit
```

---

## 7. Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a PR:

- ***

## 8. Working on Features

1. Create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/some-feature
```

2. Work in the relevant `packages/` subfolder.

3. Write or update tests.

4. Push to your fork and open a PR against `main`.

---

## 9. Branching & Versioning

- The default branch is `main`.
- Releases are managed with [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
- CI will bump versions and publish to npm.

Run this before merging a feature:

```bash
yarn changeset
```

This will prompt you to describe the change and its version impact (patch, minor, major).
